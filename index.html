       <h6>
        Africa is the fastest-growing (population), youngest continent. 
        The Sub-Saharan economy has struggled to meet expectations. This project aims to shed light on relevant factors for growth in the last decade.

        <p class="caption">
            The economy has been relatively low-growth for several sectors and also vulnerable to fluctuations, especially in trade.
            Some of the most important sectors to growth, like agricultue, manufacturing, and industry are not growings as fast as one would hope.

        Growth by Region

        <p class="caption">
        Each circle is a country in a given year. When a point is above the horizontal line, GDP growth is positive.
        The vertical line is the average GNI in sub-Saharan Africa in 2020. 
        As can be seen in the graph, most people in the region are at low-income levels, and it is only in Southern Africa
        where countries have been able to reach lower-middle to middle income levels in recent years (2017-2020). 
        There have also been many instances of negative growth in the past decade.

            The darker the green, the lower the mean emissions (Carbon Dioxide Tons) per capita of a country in the time period of 2011-2020.
            The richer countries in Southern Africa are starting to pollute more than the rest of the continent.
